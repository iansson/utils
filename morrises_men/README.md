# Morrises Men
All Morrrises' men will find their way here. 

This is an educational project, created by me, for me. The goal for the project is to:

- Create a framework suitable for multiple variations of Nine Men's Morris
- Implement different AIs and compare them
- Mess around with game design by creating custom games inspired by Nine Men's Morris
